# Cafe Keeper

CafeKeeper is an inventory management system for a cafe. The finished system will include a database and user interface. Users will be able to update and keep track of their stock of coffee, baked goods, and other items. The system will generate reports and prompt users to restock items as they are needed. 

As of now the project includes methods to add items, increment or decrement the quantities of items currently in the database, remove items from database, and display the current inventory items in the database.
